console.log(Math.random());           //deafult it creates a decimal number and this number in between 0 and 1
console.log(Math.random()*100);           // still we get decimal but not between 0 and 1 in between 0 to 100 still we get decimal
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*100));           // This math.floor is which is rounding it down to nearest integer.
