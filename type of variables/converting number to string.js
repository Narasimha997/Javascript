let a=1
let b="2";
console.log(a+b);       // Basically we all know that the output is "12" because one is number and other one is string "+" operrator will do concatination so that's why we get "12"
// For this case these convartion of data type
//for convertion of String-String()
//ex:
let str=6
console.log(str,typeof str);      // Here, the output is 6 number
str=String(str);
console.log(str,typeof str);      // Here, the output is 6 string 
// In the second case the number turned into string by using String()
